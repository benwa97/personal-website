		📍 Born and raised in the Chicago suburbs, currently living in SE Wisconsin.
	</p>

	<p>
		👨🏼‍💻 I have been working professionally as a software engineer for over 6 years. 
		I currently lead a team of engineers focused on building tools used by water utilities across the globe. See my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benwawczak/">LinkedIn</a> for more details.

		😎 Outside of work I enjoy spending time in northern Wisconsin, snowmobiling in the winter and boating in the summer. 
        If not up north, you can find me discovering new music, casually watching sports (BEAR DOWN), getting into a good tv show, or playing a video game. 
		I used to swim competitively, although it has been a while since I've touched a pool.

		🎵 I enjoy listening to and discovering all kinds of music. My go to genres are house/chill edm or alternative rock, but seriously, I will listen to anything. My favorite artist is ODESZA. 
		You can find me active in the <a href="https://discord.gg/ffcollective">Foreign Family Collective Discord</a> where I am a well known moderator as well as creator of the server's custom bot.

	<p>
		✈️ I have traveled to 23 states, 8 countries, and growing a list of places I still want to go.
